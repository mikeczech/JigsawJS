JigsawJS
============

A collaborative jigsaw puzzle game that is written in Javascript, HTML5, and NodeJS. The following features are implemented at this time:

- Create jigsaw puzzle games easily from a custom image or photo,
- solve the jigsaw puzzle in your browser (by using the JS-client),
- invite friends to the game easily just by sending a link to them.

<i>Note that this project wasn't originally developed on GitHub. I just like to share the code :)</i>
